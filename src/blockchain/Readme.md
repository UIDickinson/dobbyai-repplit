# Blockchain Module

This directory is reserved for future on-chain interaction features.

## Status: Coming Soon ðŸš§

DobbyAI does not currently support on-chain interactions. When users ask about blockchain features, respond with:

> "This version of DobbyAI doesn't support on-chain tasks yet, but it's coming in a future update! For now, I can help you understand blockchain concepts, discuss Sentient Labs technology, and answer your AI-related questions. ðŸ¤“"


When implemented, this module will support:

### 1. Token Operations
- Fetch Transaction history
- Check token balances

### 3. Smart Contract Interactions
- Read contract data
- Execute contract functions
- Monitor events

### 5. NFT Features
- View NFT collections
- NFT metadata retrieval

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Choose Web3 Library**: ethers.js or web3.js
2. **RPC Providers**: Infura, Alchemy, or custom nodes
3. **Security**: Never store private keys, use secure signing methods
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper RPC call throttling
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle network issues
6. **Gas Management**: Estimate and display gas costs


## Security Considerations

- Although this would only be deployed on testnet but never commit private keys or mnemonics
- Use environment variables for RPC URLs
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper nonce management
